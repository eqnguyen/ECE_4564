pistatsd.py - publish stats on network and CPU utilization to a RabbitMQ broker
pistatsview.py - subcribes to network and CPU utilization stats from a RabbitMQ broker


Run the project with commands like these:
	usage: pistatsd.py [-h] -b B [-p P] [-c C] -k K
	usage: pistatsview.py [-h] -b B [-p P] [-c C] -k K

	arguments:
	  -h, --help  show this help message and exit
	  -b B        IP/named address of the message broker
	  -p P        Virtual host (default is "/"), we used "rabbit_host"
	  -c C 	      login:password (default is "guest:guest"), we used "rabbit_user:rabbit_pass"
	  -k K        routing key

RabbitMQ installation and setup
	sudo apt-get update
	sudo apt-get install rabbitmq-server

	use the following for enabling remote connection
		sudo rabbitmqctl add_user "rabbit_user" "rabbit_pass"
		sudo rabbitmqctl add_vhost "rabbit_vhost"
		sudo rabbitmqctl set_permissions -p "rabbit_vhost" "rabbit_user"  ".*" ".*" ".*"

		
MongoDB installation and setup
	sudo apt-get update
	sudo apt-get install mongodb-server

Initialization procedures within scripts:
    pistatsd.py - On excecution of this script using the above switches it:

        2. Connects to direct exchange message broker
        3. Opens files for reading
        4. Begins main loop of sending read data

        1. Sets up gpio
        2. Parses command line input
        3. Connects to direct exchange message brokers and binds queues
        4. Binds callback functions to operate data on queue
        5. Callbacks excecute to store, process, and display data
