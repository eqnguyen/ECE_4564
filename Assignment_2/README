RabbitMQ installation and setup
	sudo apt-get update
	sudo apt-get install rabbitmq-server
	sudo pip install pika

	So far that was all that was necessary to get rabbitmq working, you'll need to add user name once we are doing a remote host. This will be done with
		sudo rabbitmqctl add_user "rabbit_user" "rabbit_pass"
		sudo rabbitmqctl add_vhost "rabbit_vhost"
		sudo rabbitmqctl set_permissions -p "rabbit_vhost" "rabbit_user"  ".*" ".*" ".*"

	run rabbit scripts with destination ip like:
		python rabbit_pub 127.0.0.1
		

Required External Libraries:
    pika
    psutil (only required for pistatsd)
    pymongo (only required for pistatsview)
